# GR-ArtPrize-FoliumMap

Due to Github not cooperating with Folium maps because of 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Ambush3/GR-ArtPrize-FoliumMap/master)

I created a map showing the Grand Rapids Art Prize art locations around the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Using Folium, Matplotlib.pyplot, and Pandas.

Each icon has information for every Art Exhibit. 
Information such as the Longitude and Latitude, Property Owner, Address, Zip Code, Type of Art, Description, and Date Signed.
